The department chair reviews long distance statements for accuracy and identification of personal long-distance calls placed with access codes.  Reimbursement for personal long-distance calls are made directly to the Business Office and are credited to the department telephone account.  An online Faculty and Staff Directory is available through the Westmont Portal at https://www.my.westmont.edu/s/directory.

	\subsection{Transportation and Parking Regulations}

		Parking permits are required and are available free of charge from Campus Security.  County regulations prohibit faculty members from parking motor vehicles on campus without valid parking permits.  Parking permits must be affixed to one's vehicle in accordance with instructions.  If faculty bring substitute vehicles to campus without permits (e.g., rental car), they are to obtain temporary permits from the physical plant or the housing office.  Faculty operating vehicles found in violation of these regulations will receive an initial warning and then face fines for each occurrence, vehicle immobilization, and/or towing of the vehicle at the owner's expense.  Faculty may park in any parking lot; the Kerr Student Center lot is specifically reserved for faculty and staff during regular office hours.  Faculty should respect ``Reserved'' areas and short interval time zones during regular hours.

		Faculty members are expected to abide by all parking and traffic regulations described in the Vehicle regulations brochure and web site.  While violations will be subject to fines as described in the Regulations, fines may be appealed to the Office of Public Safety, and then to Faculty Council.  Faculty members who find that a parking regulation interferes with their teaching duties should address their concerns to Faculty Council, who will work with them and Public Safety to mitigate the difficulty.  Public Safety may also convey concerns about excessive faculty violations to Faculty Council.
	\subsection{Athletic Events and Facilities}
		Upon presenting a College identification card, a faculty member and immediate family members have free admittance to all home athletic events except play-off games.  Contact the Athletic Department for a schedule of sporting events.  Lockers are available by contacting the Athletic Trainer's office.  Faculty and their immediate families may use the swimming pool, track, tennis courts, racquetball courts, exercise room, and gym when those facilities are open and not being used for scheduled events.
	\subsection{Campus Dining}
		Meals may be purchased at the Dining Commons (the ``DC'').  Snacks and meals are also available from "Ritchie's Place", the retail coffee and snack shop located in the Global Leadership Center.  Additional information, including how to open a faculty dining account, can be found at
