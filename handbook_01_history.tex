\section{HISTORY, MISSION, GENERAL ORGANIZATION
		AND GOVERNANCE}
	\label{sec:HMGOG}
	\subsection{History}
		Early evangelical Christian institutions of higher learning were conceived to
		witness to and to preserve the viability of a world-view understood in light of
		Christian faith and tradition. Many were founded primarily for the training of
		ministers, missionaries, and teachers.

		The Bible Missionary Institute, established in 1937 in Los Angeles, was the
		direct antecedent to Westmont. It was founded by Mrs. Alexander Kerr who
		envisioned a college for training men and women for full-time Christian service,
		especially young people without the resources to attend existing institutions.

		In 1940 Westmont College was incorporated as a four-year degree-granting
		Christian liberal arts college. Having outgrown its Los Angeles facilities, the
		campus was relocated to the Dwight Murphy estate in Montecito in 1945.  Forty
		acres of the adjacent Deane School were added in 1967. Westmont was accredited
		by WASC in 1958. (For a discussion of the early history of Westmont College, see
		Nancy Phinney's article in the
		Journal of the Santa Barbara Historical Museum
		written for Westmont's 75th anniversary~\cite{Phinney2012}.)

	\subsection{Mission Statement}

		Westmont College is an undergraduate, residential, Christian, liberal arts
		community serving God's kingdom by cultivating thoughtful scholars, grateful
		servants, and faithful leaders for global engagement with the academy, church,
		and world.

		\subsubsection{Philosophy of Education}

			\paragraph {Liberal Arts}
				As a liberal arts college, Westmont seeks to help its students become certain kinds of people, not mere
				repositories of information or mere possessors of professional skills.  Where such information and
				competencies are acquired, it is to be done in an intellectual and social context that nourishes a
				larger spiritual vision and is integrated with it.  Crucially, as a liberal arts college, Westmont seeks
				to help inculcate those skills that contribute to leading a successful and satisfying life.  For just as
				one must be trained in the skills that enable one to engage in a trade, so one must be trained in those
				skills that enable one to engage in the distinctively human activities of reasoning, communicating,
				thoughtfully choosing one's moral and spiritual ends, building political, economic and spiritual
				communities, and entering into those ``appreciative pleasures" that require knowledge, experience, and
				trained discrimination. Herein lies the relationship between liberal learning and life, for these are
				the very skills that translate into performing well one's role as citizen of the state, servant of the
				church, member of a family, worker or professional and participant in the cultural world.
			\paragraph{Christian}
				Westmont College is committed to the universal truths of the Christian faith, to a high view of biblical
				authority and an orthodox doctrinal vision, and to the central importance of a personal relationship
				with God through Jesus Christ.  It is this Christian faith that the college seeks to integrate fully
				into its life as a liberal arts institution.  For the pursuit of a liberal arts education, with its
				emphasis on producing certain kinds of people and inculcating certain basic human skills essential for
				living a satisfactory life, cannot take place in isolation from one's most basic commitments and
				beliefs.  For the Christian, then, this means bringing one's biblical and theological heritage to this
				educational enterprise. Indeed, to have basic values and commitments that one cannot explicitly and
				systematically bring to this task is to have an education that is severely truncated, severed, as it
				were, from one's most important beliefs and values.  To isolate one's worldview in this way, while
				pursuing an education, will only result in a worldview uninformed by sustained intellectual reflection.
				Such an approach will yield persons who are not fully educated, indeed not educated at the core of their
				being.  For the Christian, therefore, higher education must be Christian education, if it is to be
				education for the whole person.  At Westmont, then, Christian faith is to inform the academic enterprise
				and the academic enterprise is to inform one's Christian faith and thus yield a Christian worldview that
				is biblically based and intellectually sound.
			\paragraph{Undergraduate}
				Westmont is an undergraduate college and as such directs its attention, focuses its resources and devises
				its pedagogical strategies to facilitate the development of students who are beginning their post-secondary
				education.  It follows that the primary emphasis at Westmont is on teaching.  But teaching often involves
				helping students to acquire research skills and to become themselves producers of knowledge.  This can be
				done effectively only as faculty model research skills for students, and mentor them in the acquisition of
				those skills.  Moreover, to create a vital intellectual environment profitable for undergraduate students,
				Westmont must be an institution where knowledge is generated as well as transmitted.  But producing such
				knowledge is to be largely (though not exclusively) evaluated and appreciated in terms of the benefits that
				accrue, directly or indirectly, to those undergraduates who have come to Westmont to receive their
				education. For it is those students that the educational programs at Westmont are dedicated.
			\paragraph{Residential}
				The educational programs of Westmont College are residential in character and reflect a commitment to
				facilitate and exploit the ways in which education occurs within community.  Indeed, ever since the monastic
				tradition, learning has been cultivated and transmitted within residential communities, enabling learning to
				be promoted by the joys of shared exploration and the sustenance of spiritual kinship.  Moreover, both the
				Christian and liberal arts traditions remind us of the integrity of human wholeness; we cannot be neatly
				compartmentalized into rational, spiritual and affective components.  The residential character allows and
				encourages expression of this wholeness as we live, learn and worship together.  Further, the residential
				character of the college reflects the conviction that the goal of all meaningful learning, and of biblical
				education in particular, is to inform the way we live.  The residential character of the college invites
				students to apply their studies to the daily task of creating a community in which individuals can grow and
				mature together.  Students are able to cultivate these patterns of adulthood and redemptive living in the
				presence of role models and mentors who can help them in this process.
			\paragraph{Global}
				Westmont is to be a college with global concerns.  For the earth and all its peoples are God's good
				creation.  As such, they must be appropriately valued and respected.  We are called in scripture to be
				stewards of the earth, to be faithful caretakers of the physical creation.  We are also called to appreciate
				the rich diversity of human cultures --- cultures shaped by people who bear the mark of God's image in
				creation.  We are, then to be a community informed and enriched by thoughtful and intentional study of and
				interaction with cultures other than our own.  Ours is, however, a fallen world, and the earth, its peoples,
				and their institutions stand in need of the redemptive, reconciling word of the gospel.  We are called,
				therefore, not only to appreciate and preserve the creation and human cultures, but also to participate in
				the work of the Kingdom in response to the Great Commission to make disciples of all nations --- to bring
				all creation and human institutions under the Lordship of Christ.  This task involves grappling with the
				full range of ways in which the fall has introduced blindness, disintegration, conflict, and injustice into
				the world.  Finally, the emphasis on the global nature of education is recognition that our world has
				increasingly become interconnected and interdependent.  To prepare people to function intelligently,
				effectively and for the good in a world of global politics, global economics, and global communications must
				be one of the aims of a Westmont education.

		\subsubsection{Faculty}
			\label{sec:CollegeOrganization-Faculty}

			University and college faculty have a significant role in the
			governance of the academy. At Westmont College, the faculty, under
			the final authority of the Board of Trustees, exercise primary
			authority over instruction and curriculum and share authority for
			many standards and policies.  While specific administrative
			functions have been assigned to individual faculty committees, the
			authority to recommend major changes in policy or to advise the
			administration or Board of Trustees on central issues of
			College-wide concerns rests with the faculty as a whole.

			\paragraph{Final Authority}

				The Board of Trustees has final authority to approve substantive changes in institutional purposes, policies, and programs.  The Board normally exercises its responsibility on campus through the President, who is expected to provide leadership within the entire educational program of the College.

			\paragraph{Primary Authority}
				\label{sec:CollegeOrganization-Faculty-PrimaryAuthority}
				\begin{enumerate}

					\item{ The faculty, together with the Provost, govern curriculum
						and formulate academic policies through formal action in
						faculty meetings and the committee structure; the latter is
						used to implement established policy, to develop and
						recommend changes, and to interpret policy as necessary.}
					\item{
						\label{sec:CollegeOrganization-Faculty-PrimaryAuthority-Curricular}
						Curricular and academic policy changes are processed

						through the Academic Senate. The following items require
						submission by the Faculty Council for action by the full
						faculty for implementation:
						\begin{enumerate}
							\item{ the addition or deletion of a major;}

							\item{ the addition or deletion of a complete field of study, including any programs which
								do not fall within the direct supervision of an existing academic department or any
								Westmont-operated semester-long off-campus study program;}

							\item{ the addition or deletion of a graduation requirement;}

	\subsection{Protocols for Revision of the \emph{Faculty Handbook}}
		\label{sec:ProtocolsForRevision}
		\subsubsection{Publication}
			\label{sec:ProtocolsForRevision-Publication}
			The current version of the \emph{Faculty Handbook} will be maintained online at the Provost's website. Every three years the Faculty Council will confer with the Provost to carry out a comprehensive review of the \emph{Faculty Handbook} to ensure its completeness and accuracy.
		\subsubsection{Sources of Initiative for Revisions}
			\label{sec:ProtocolsForRevision-Sources}
			\paragraph{Board of Trustees}
				Revisions proposed by the Board of Trustees do not require the faculty's approval, but should be submitted to the faculty for discussion and response before adoption.
			\paragraph{President or Provost}
				Revisions proposed by the President or the Provost are subject to the approval either of the Board of Trustees, or of the faculty according to the procedure specified in
				section
				\ref{sec:ProtocolsForRevision-Sources-FacultyCouncil}
				.

			\paragraph{Faculty Council}
				\label{sec:ProtocolsForRevision-Sources-FacultyCouncil}
				Revisions proposed by the Faculty Council are subject to the approval of the full faculty. Such proposals will be provided in writing to all faculty members at least one week prior to the faculty's action. Adoption requires a two-thirds majority vote of the eligible faculty present.
			\paragraph{Faculty}
				Revisions proposed by faculty will qualify for consideration by having the endorsement of at least one-fourth of the whole number of faculty eligible to vote. This procedure is an exception to the normal means by which motions may be brought to the faculty by an individual voting member (see
				section
				\ref{sec:FacultyMeetings}~\ref{sec:FacultyMeetings-Procedures}~\ref{sec:FacultyMeetings-Procedures-RobertsRules}).

				Such revisions are subject to the approval of the whole faculty according to the procedure specified in
				section
				\ref{sec:ProtocolsForRevision-Sources-FacultyCouncil}
		\subsubsection{Authorization of Revisions}
			The Provost, in consultation with Faculty Council, will adjudicate all questions concerning the status of a revision as ``substantive'' or ``non-substantive,'' and ``automatic'' or ``non-automatic''.
			\paragraph{Non-Substantive Revisions}
				\label{sec:NonSubstantiveRevisions}
				The President or the Provost or the Faculty Council, or a designate of any of them, may authorize non-substantive revisions for the sake of correctness (e.g., of spelling, grammar, and mechanics), or of internal consistency (in graphics, e.g., fonts, layouts; in forms of word, e.g., shall/will, chair/chairperson; in formats, e.g., the organization of committee descriptions), or of clarity (e.g., the renumbering of sections).
			\paragraph{Substantive Revisions}
				\subparagraph{Automatic Revisions}
					Certain revisions of substance are automatically contingent on events and circumstances beyond the College's powers of choice (e.g.,
					\ref{sec:GovernmentMandatedBenefits}~(``\nameref{sec:GovernmentMandatedBenefits}'')
					or the constitution of the Christian College Consortium in
					section
					\ref{sec:AccreditationAndMemberships}~(``\nameref{sec:AccreditationAndMemberships}'')
					). These revisions will require no additional authorization, and will be treated according to the procedures for non-substantive revisions (
					section
					\ref{sec:NonSubstantiveRevisions}
					).
				\subparagraph{Non-Automatic Revisions}
					Following approval of any non-automatic revision by two-thirds majority vote of the faculty as specified in section
					\ref{sec:ProtocolsForRevision-Sources-FacultyCouncil}
					, the motion will then require the approval of the President and the Board of Trustees.
		\subsubsection{Emergency Suspension of a \emph{Faculty Handbook} Provision}
			\label{sec:EmergencySuspension}
			The Faculty may choose to suspend a provision of the handbook by a four-fifths vote of the eligible faculty present, upon one week's prior written notice.  Such suspensions shall be limited to issues of faculty governance (e.g., make-up of committees) rather than issues that impact faculty contracts, faculty disciplinary hearings, or trustee governance.
